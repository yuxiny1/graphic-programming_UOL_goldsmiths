Cool graphic programming projects


1. Manipulate numerical representations of visual media. 
2. Explain the basic mathematical and theoretical principles of visual computing. 
3. Write basic but complete graphics software systems 
4. Apply filters on images in order to transform them for processing in computer vision scenarios. 
5. Explain the fundamental tenets of computer vision and write code that processes images to make intelligent assertions about their content. 
6. Select and use software libraries for software development.
